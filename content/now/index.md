# What I'm doing now
This is my [now page](https://nownownow.com/about). 

## Formula SAE
I compete on Sun Devil Motorsports, ASU's Formula SAE team, as the Data Acquisition team lead, where we are responsible for integrating sensors into a Formula-style race car to validate its design and extract the most performance out of it. 
Currently we are working on a redesign of our data acquisition system to allow for easy modifications, simpler cable runs, and collecting data from the ECU.
Our code and PCB designs can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/sundevilmotorsports) while the team website can be found [here](https://fsae.engineering.asu.edu/).

## 18x18az
I volunteer with [18x18az](https://18x18az.org), a non-profit specializing in hosting high-quality VEX Robotics Competition (VRC) tournaments.
Most recently, we've successfully hosted both state championships for the 2022-23 season.
We've also been developing a companion software to Tournament Manager, the program used to run VRC tournaments, to allow us to make custom audience displays, volunteer interfaces, and automate livestream management.

## Arizona State University
I'm currently in my fourth year at ASU studying Computer Science and Mathematics, and I'm expecting to graduate in May 2024.

## Laptop
I use Arch, btw
