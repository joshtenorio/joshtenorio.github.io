# What I'm doing now
This is my [now page](https://nownownow.com/about). 

## Formula SAE
I compete on ASU's Formula SAE team as the Data Acquisition team lead, where we are responsible for integrating sensors into a Formula-style race car. 
Currently we are working on a redesign of our data acquisition system to allow for easy modifications, simpler cable runs, and collecting data from the ECU.
Our code can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/sundevilmotorsports).

## 18x18az
I volunteer with [18x18az](https://18x18az.org), a non-profit specializing in hosting high-quality VEX Robotics Competition (VRC) tournaments.
Most recently, we've successfully hosted both state championships for the 2021-22 season.
We've also been developing a companion software to Tournament Manager, the program used to run VRC tournaments, to allow us to make custom audience displays and run tournaments more smoothly.

## Arizona State University
I'm currently in my third year at ASU studying Computer Science and Mathematics, and am expecting to graduate in May 2024.
