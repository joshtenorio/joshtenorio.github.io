# What I'm doing now
This is my [now page](https://nownownow.com/about). 

## Formula SAE
I compete on ASU's Formula SAE team as part of the Data Acquisition subteam, where we are responsible for integrating various sensors into the racecar. 
This year, I am primarily responsible for developing the data dashboard, which will playback recorded data from the car and plot them into various graphs.
For the future, we hope to add telemetry viewing to the dashboard where we can view live data from the racecar as it is running.
Our code can be found on [Github](https://github.com/sundevilmotorsports).

## CanSat
I compete with a team of other ASU students to design and build a payload to complete specific objectives in the [CanSat Competition](http://www.cansatcompetition.com/).
Previously, I have worked on the ground station software, which receives telemetry from the payload container, plots data in real time, and sends commands back to the container. The code for the ground station software can be found on [Github](https://github.com/SamarthSingh2001/Cansat-2021).

## SC2 AI Arena
I'm creating a bot to play StarCraft 2 against other bots on the [SC2 AI Arena ladder](https://aiarena.net/).
Its code can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/joshtenorio/monte-bot).

## Arizona State University
I'm currently in my second year at ASU studying Computer Science and Mathematics.
