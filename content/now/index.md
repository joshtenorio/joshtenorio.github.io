# What I'm doing now
This is my [now page](https://nownownow.com/about). 

## Formula SAE
I compete on ASU's Formula SAE team as part of the Data Acquisition subteam, where we are responsible for integrating sensors into a Formula-style race car. 
Currently we are working on a redesign of our data acquisition system to allow for easy modifications, simpler cable runs, and compiling data from the ECU.
Our code can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/sundevilmotorsports).

## 18x18az
I volunteer with [18x18az](https://github.com/18x18az), a non-profit specializing in hosting high-quality VEX Robotics Competition (VRC) tournaments where students can showcase the fruits of their very own engineering design processes in an engaging competitive atmosphere.
We've been developing a companion software to Tournament Manager, the program used to run VRC tournaments, to allow us to make custom audience displays and run tournaments more smoothly.

## CanSat
I compete with a team of other ASU students to design and build a payload to complete specific objectives in the [CanSat Competition](http://www.cansatcompetition.com/).
Previously, I have worked on the ground station software, which receives telemetry from the payload container, plots data in real time, and sends commands back to the container.
The code for that ground station software can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/SamarthSingh2001/Cansat-2021).
This year I'm working on the CAD models for the container and payload.

## Arizona State University
I'm currently in my second year at ASU studying Computer Science and Mathematics, and am expecting to graduate in May 2024.
