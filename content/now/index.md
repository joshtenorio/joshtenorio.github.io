# What I'm doing now
This is my [now page](https://nownownow.com/about). 

## CanSat
I compete with a team of other ASU students to design and build a payload to complete specific objectives in the [CanSat Competition](http://www.cansatcompetition.com/).
I am a part of the electrical subsystem team, and this year I am primarily responsible for developing the ground station software, which receives telemetry from the payload container, plots data in real time, and sends commands back to the container. Our code can be found [here](https://github.com/SamarthSingh2001/Cansat-2021).

## SC2 AI Arena
I'm creating a bot to play StarCraft 2 against other bots on the [SC2 AI Arena ladder](https://aiarena.net/).
Its code can be found [here](https://github.com/joshtenorio/monte-bot).

## Arizona State University
I'm currently in my second year at ASU studying Computer Science.
