# About Me

Hi there! My name is Josh, and I'm currently studying Computer Science at Arizona State University.

In my free time I enjoy spending time with friends, competing in various competitions, and watching animes and kdramas that interest me. If you're curious, [here](/now) is what I am working on now.
