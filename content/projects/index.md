# Projects

## Formula SAE Data Acquisition
I'm currently leading the design and manufacturing of a data acquistion system for Sun Devil Motorsports, Arizona State's Formula SAE team.
This includes (but is not limited to) the PCB and wiring harness design, sensor selection, embedded software, and data processing scripts.
Our code and PCB designs can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/sundevilmotorsports) while the team website can be found [here](https://fsae.engineering.asu.edu/).
The design report for the SDM-23 Data Acquisition system can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/sundevilmotorsports/sdm23_designreport/releases/tag/release).

## SC2 AI Arena
I've created a C++ bot named Monte to play StarCraft II.
It plays Terran with a 3-1-1 build order, mainly building a marine/medivac/siege tank composition with liberator harass.
Its page on SC2 AI Arena can be found [here](https://aiarena.net/bots/310/) and the code can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/joshtenorio/monte-sc2).
During its best season, it was able to achieve a 47% winrate in its division.

## Boba Bot
Boba bot was my friends' and I's submission to sunhacks 2021, a hackathon hosted at ASU.
It's a Discord bot built with Python designed to give the user boba drink recommendations.
The code can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/joshtenorio/boba-bot) and a demonstration can be found on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGLsBpBqap0&ab_channel=tenmo).

## Battlesnake
I competed in [Battlesnake's](https://play.battlesnake.com/) Summer League 2021, and placed in the top four in the gold tier tournament.
The code for my bot (written using Go) can be found on [GitHub](https://play.battlesnake.com/u/tenmo/ninemo/), and a writeup of its strategy can be found [here](/posts/battlesnakesummer21).
