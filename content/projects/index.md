# Projects

## SC2 AI Arena
I've created a C++ bot named Monte to play StarCraft II.
Its page on SC2 AI Arena can be found [here](https://aiarena.net/bots/310/) and the code can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/joshtenorio/monte-sc2).
During its best season, it was able to achieve a 47% winrate in its division.

## Battlesnake
I competed in [Battlesnake's](https://play.battlesnake.com/) Summer League 2021, and placed in the top four in the gold tier tournament.
The code for my bot can be found on [GitHub](https://play.battlesnake.com/u/tenmo/ninemo/), and a writeup of its strategy can be found [here](/posts/battlesnakesummer21).
