      <description>What I&amp;rsquo;m doing now This is my now page.
CanSat I compete with a team of other ASU students to design and build a payload to complete specific objectives in the CanSat Competition. I am a part of the electrical subsystem team, and this year I am primarily responsible for developing the ground station software, which receives telemetry from the container, plots data in real time, and sends commands back to the container.</description>
