      <description>Earlier this summer, I learned of a programming competition called Battlesnake. Having acquired a lot of free time after the end of my first year of college, I entered a battlesnake into their summer league competition and took the opportunity to learn Go.
The Competition Battlesnake is a battle royale-esque game where there are initially 4 snakes on the board, each controlled autonomously by a developer&amp;rsquo;s program. In short:
 Each snake has a health bar which depletes a little each turn.</description>

Formula SAE I compete on ASU&amp;rsquo;s Formula SAE team as part of the Data Acquisition subteam, where we are responsible for integrating sensors into a Formula-style race car.
